## Prerequisites

This is a single page web app and requires only static web hosting to deploy the service.

We recommend hosting on your own app platform or service, creating an Azure storage account, or integrating the code directly into your own experience.

## Setup

### Register an Azure AD application

You'll need to register an app through the following process:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
2. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the Azure AD tenant that you want.
3. Select **New registration**.
4. When the Register an application page appears, enter your application's registration information:
   * **Name** - Enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app.
   * **Supported account types** - Select which accounts you would like your application to support.
5. When finished, select **Register**.
6. Azure AD assigns a unique application (client) ID to your app, and you're taken to your application's Overview page.

    Copy the Application Id. This is the unique identifier for your app.

7. Under **Manage** on the left-hand pane, click **Authentication**. Under **Redirect URIs**, click **Add URI** and enter the following URIs one by one.
    * `http://localhost:3000/signin`
    * `http://localhost:3000/createMeeting`

    On the same page, under **Implicit grant**, make sure that both **Access tokens** and **ID tokens** checkboxes are checked.

    Click **Save** to save your changes.

7. Under **Manage** on the left-hand pane, click **API permissions** and then **Add a new permission**. Select **Microsoft Graph** and then **Delegated permissions**. Add the `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite` (Read and create user's online meetings) permission.

### Update the configuration

Change the following values in the `msalApp.ts` file:
* **clientId** - Set this to the Application (client) ID of the AAD application that you registered

## Running the sample

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
